### Future Changes 

1. In script.pug I started to create a feature that would allow admin users to be able to go to a certain day of posts. That feature was unfinished, part of my inability to finish lied in the Node.js framework. In Javascript you can use document.getElementById to parse information from an HTML file. When researching I discovered that you actually needed to use jsdom and initialize a document first. 

2. Adding more posts. Currently the timeline can go on for about 16 days, but this needs to be shown, more posts needs to be added to make it look real. 

3. More diverse content. I created content that reflected my community, hopefully other developers can do the same since Black and Brown voices are being left out of this platform.
